This is a project where I implemented some examples in Java, related to multithreading, concurrency and performance optimization, seeking to improve my knowledge on these subjects and also in the intention to use them for future consultations by me and also by anyone else interested in this subject.
Subjects:
* Thread creation and coordination

* Data sharing between threads
* Concurrency: Challenges and solutions
* Concurrency: Locking strategies
* Inter-Thread communication
